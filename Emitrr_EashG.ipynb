        "Physician: That makes sense. Are you still experiencing pain now?\n",
        "Patient: It’s not constant, but I do get occasional backaches. It’s nothing like before, though.\n",
        "Physician: That’s good to hear. Have you noticed any other effects, like anxiety while driving or difficulty concentrating?\n",
        "Patient: No, nothing like that. I don’t feel nervous driving, and I haven’t had any emotional issues from the accident.\n",
        "Physician: And how has this impacted your daily life? Work, hobbies, anything like that?\n",
        "Patient: I had to take a week off work, but after that, I was back to my usual routine. It hasn’t really stopped me from doing anything.\n",
